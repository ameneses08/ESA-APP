# ESA-APP
# **Description:**
Welcome to the repository of our Everyday Services App. This is a digital space where we store, manage, and track all the different files, code, and documentation related to our project. 

Our Everyday Services App is designed to connect people who provide services with those who need them. Whether you’re a plumber, a tutor, a dog walker, or someone looking for these services, our app aims to bridge that gap and facilitate these connections. We chose to use technologies that are robust, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that our app can handle a large number of users and services while providing a seamless user experience. Some of these technologies include version control systems, hosting/cloud services, databases, APIs, backend development, and frontend development, each chosen for their specific strengths and capabilities.


The repository serves as the backbone of our project. It contains all the code that makes our app function, the documentation that explains how to use and contribute to the project, and the version history that allows us to track and manage changes over time. One of the key features of this repository is its collaborative nature. We believe in the power of community and collective intelligence. Therefore, we encourage contributions from everyone. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer, your perspective and skills can help enhance our project and make our app better.

# How to Install and Run the Project:

In order to conduct both operations, running and installing the project, the user will need to refer to the "Code" section present at the top of this repository. The user will click on the download icon, which will then proceed to start the downloading process of the code. After the download is complete, the code will need to be opened in the desired dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

Once the code is copied into the environment, the user will return to the github repository and refer to the "Resources" section, where they will find the "Datasets' folder with the "service provider" database inside. The user will need to download and save this file in the same directory as the code that was prevoiusly downloaded. Afterwards, the user will need to read the file in their desired python Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Once the file has been read, the user is free to start using the project.


# How to Use the Project:
This project is currently in its early stages of development and primarily includes the basic functions of the application. Here’s how you can use it:

- Open the Code section in this repository: After opening this section and encountering the code, the user should continue to press the download icon on the top right corner to proceed to downloading the code.

- Open the newly downloaded file: The file can be opened in any desired python environment, nevertheless in order to ensure correct implementation of the code, the user should use python version "Python 3.11.5"

- Obtain the necesary dataset: Once the file is opened in the desired python environment, the user should return to the github repository and address the "Resources/Datasets" folders. Inside they will find the "service providers file. This is the file necessary to run the project. This file will need to be downloaded and saved in the same directory as the python file the user is working on. 

- Read the file: After downloading and saving the respective dataset, the user needs to read the excel file before running the code. This can be done through the command...
  
- Customization to Suit Individual Preferences: It is understood that each user has distinct needs and preferences. Therefore, users are encouraged to tailor the information provided by the code to meet their specific requirements. Users are free to create a copy of the dataframe and modify it as they see fit. The aim is to provide comprehensive information, but it is acknowledged that not all of it may be relevant to every user. If users are specifically interested in babysitting options, they have the flexibility to filter the dataset accordingly. The goal is to support users in finding the most suitable and relevant information.

Please note that this project is still under development, and the current version only includes the basic functions of the application. We’re working hard to add more features and improve the user interface and design. Stay tuned for updates!
