# ESA-APP
# **Description:**
Welcome to the repository of our Everyday Services App. This is a digital space where we store, manage, and track all the different files, code, and documentation related to our project. 

Our Everyday Services App is designed to connect people who provide services with those who need them. Whether you’re a plumber, a tutor, a dog walker, or someone looking for these services, our app aims to bridge that gap and facilitate these connections. We chose to use technologies that are robust, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that our app can handle a large number of users and services while providing a seamless user experience. Some of these technologies include version control systems, hosting/cloud services, databases, APIs, backend development, and frontend development, each chosen for their specific strengths and capabilities.


The repository serves as the backbone of our project. It contains all the code that makes our app function, the documentation that explains how to use and contribute to the project, and the version history that allows us to track and manage changes over time. One of the key features of this repository is its collaborative nature. We believe in the power of community and collective intelligence. Therefore, we encourage contributions from everyone. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer, your perspective and skills can help enhance our project and make our app better.

# How to Install and Run the Project

In order to conduct both operations, running and installing the project, the user will need to refer to the "Code" section present in this repository. The user will have the opportunity to copy the code and run it in their desired dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Once the code is copied into the environment, the user will continue to enter their input and make any changes to the code that fit their own personal objectives.

# How to Use the Project
This project is currently in its early stages of development and primarily includes the basic functions of the application. Here’s how you can use it:

- Open the Code: The first step is to open the code. You can do this by navigating to the file containing the code in this repository.

- Copy the Code: Once you’ve opened the file, you can copy the code. Simply select all the code (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) and then copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).

- Paste in Python Environment: Next, open your Python environment. This could be any environment where Python code can be executed, such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or even the Python IDLE. Once open, paste the copied code into this environment (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).

- Run the Code: After pasting the code, you can run it. Usually, there’s a ‘Run’ button or similar in your Python environment, or you can use a keyboard shortcut like F5.

- Adapt to Your Needs: The code is flexible and can be adapted to suit your needs. Feel free to modify or extend the code as necessary.

Please note that this project is still under development, and the current version only includes the basic functions of the application. We’re working hard to add more features and improve the user interface and design. Stay tuned for updates!
