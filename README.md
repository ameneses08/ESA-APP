# ESA-APP
# **Description:**
Welcome to the repository of our Everyday Services App. This is a digital space where we store, manage, and track all the different files, code, and documentation related to our project. 

Our Everyday Services App is designed to connect people who provide services with those who need them. Whether you’re a plumber, a tutor, a dog walker, or someone looking for these services, our app aims to bridge that gap and facilitate these connections. We chose to use technologies that are robust, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that our app can handle a large number of users and services while providing a seamless user experience. Some of these technologies include version control systems, hosting/cloud services, databases, APIs, backend development, and frontend development, each chosen for their specific strengths and capabilities.


The repository serves as the backbone of our project. It contains all the code that makes our app function, the documentation that explains how to use and contribute to the project, and the version history that allows us to track and manage changes over time. One of the key features of this repository is its collaborative nature. We believe in the power of community and collective intelligence. Therefore, we encourage contributions from everyone. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer, your perspective and skills can help enhance our project and make our app better.

# How to Install and Run the Project:

- Refer to the GitHub repository: At the top of the GitHub repository, the user will find a green icon that displays “<> Code”.

- Download the project: The user should click on the green icon to display several options. They should choose the option that says “Download Zip”. This will download all the files 
  present in the repository, enabling the user to access the project's files.

- Open the downloaded file: Once the download is complete, the user should open the file which is called “ESA-APP-main 2”.

- Open the code folder: The user should continue by opening the code folder and the document inside, preferably in the python environment called pycharm version 2023.2.
  
- Run the module: The user should look for an option called “Run” in the toolbar at the right upper part of their screen. They should choose this "Run" option. This will Initialize the application.

# How to Use the Project:
This project is currently in its early stages of development and primarily includes the basic functions of the application. Here’s how you can use it:

- Initialize the application: Clicking “Run” will initialize the application. Now, the user is good to go and can start searching for their desired service.

- Choose the search criteria: The screen will present options for choosing the search criteria (name, sector, rating, price, distance). The user should select the desired search criteria.

- Search by sector: If “sector” is chosen as the search criteria, the user should type the desired sector. For example, if one is looking for a plumber, they should type “plumbing”. This will display all the service providers that offer plumbing services.

- Search by name: If the user desires to search by name, they just need to type the name of their desired service provider. This will display the series of services performed by the service provider.

- Search by rating: If the user desires to search by rating, they just need to type the minimum rating each service provider should have. This will display all of the service providers that contain a rating equal to or higher than what was chosen.

- Search by distance: If the user desires to search by distance, they should type their desired distance in kilometers. This will give them a list of all of the services provided within the chosen distance.

- Search by price: If the user wants to search by price, they simply need to type the maximum price they’re willing to pay. A list of available services within the price range will appear.

Please note that this project is still under development, and the current version only includes the basic functions of the application. We’re working hard to add more features and improve the user interface and design. Stay tuned for updates!
