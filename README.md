# ESA-APP
# **Description:**
Welcome to the repository of our Everyday Services App. This is a digital space where we store, manage, and track all the different files, code, and documentation related to our project. 

Our Everyday Services App is designed to connect people who provide services with those who need them. Whether you’re a plumber, a tutor, a dog walker, or someone looking for these services, our app aims to bridge that gap and facilitate these connections. We chose to use technologies that are robust, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that our app can handle a large number of users and services while providing a seamless user experience. Some of these technologies include version control systems, hosting/cloud services, databases, APIs, backend development, and frontend development, each chosen for their specific strengths and capabilities.


The repository serves as the backbone of our project. It contains all the code that makes our app function, the documentation that explains how to use and contribute to the project, and the version history that allows us to track and manage changes over time. One of the key features of this repository is its collaborative nature. We believe in the power of community and collective intelligence. Therefore, we encourage contributions from everyone. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a newcomer, your perspective and skills can help enhance our project and make our app better.
